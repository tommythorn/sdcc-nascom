/*
 * Let's make an editor like Nascom always deserved (sorry Anders, BLS
 * Pascal had a good one, but I want better).
 *
 * Features:
 * - FAST: access the screen memory directly
 * - 16 lines: use the crazy header line
 * - Compact: buffer is just the dense text + space for insertion
 * - Initial features: cursor navigation, self-insert charactors,
 *   delete, page up, page down.
 *
 * The text is stored in the buffer with everything before the
 * insertion cursor residing from beginning of buffer, everything
 * after the cursor is flushed to the end of the buffer, and the hole
 * in the middle is space for inserted text.  As the insertion cursor
 * is moved, text is moved between the two halves.
 *
 * Lines are limited to 127 characters.  This enables us to prefix
 * every line with a byte giving the length of the line.  This byte
 * has bit 7 set so we can distinguish it when scanning backwards.
 *
 * Step 1: display buffer and page down and up.
